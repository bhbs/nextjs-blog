It's been almost a year since I joined the web industry. I was often told that "the flow of information is so fast that you have to study constantly.", but I've been thinking, "Isn't everyone studying so much?
".

Having said that, I also have fewer opportunities to try out new technologies and learn existing ones compared to when I was a student and had more time. At this rate, I don't think I will be able to become the engineer I am aiming to be. Since the new year has just started, I'm going to start "Write Code Every Day".
