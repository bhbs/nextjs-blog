It's been almost a year since I joined the web industry. I was often told that "the flow of information is so fast that you have to study constantly.", but I've been thinking, "Isn't everyone studying so much?
". Engineers are polarized into two groups: those at the top are those who keep studying, or those who can do overwhelmingly well without studying. At the bottom, there seem to be a lot of people who have no talent or even interest. (Maybe I'm just looking at it too narrowly and for too short a period of time.) Even if they are less capable, they seem to be able to make it for many years without getting fired or anything.

Having said that, I also have clearly less opportunities to try out new technologies and learn existing ones compared to when I was a student and had more time. At this rate, I don't think I will be able to become the engineer I am aiming to be. Since the new year has just started, I'm going to start "Write Code Every Day".
